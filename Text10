What are you going to do now?
Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
I’m sorry you have to go through this.
This might take time.
It’s okay to be sad.
I am sure everything will work out for the best for everyone.
Hang in there. Things will get better.
Get some rest and take care of yourself.
