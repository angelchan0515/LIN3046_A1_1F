Ok comforting someone over a text wouldn't even help the person affected at all. First you have a good heart if you get annoyed when people are at their lowest but comforting the affected person is hard and it's starts by you being there for them at troubled times next you should listen and make them come open about their problem next be a good listener and try thinking of the bright side and ways on how to solve the problem they're experiencing. By the way if you're comforting someone you shouldn't force it let the person chill out/get some fresh air before you can access them

Don’t be afraid to ask them what they need, no one can be expected to read minds. Comforting is a learned skill that needs to be nurtured and there is no guideline for it because people need different things. If you’re trying your best to comfort someone that is what counts.
