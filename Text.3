When life hands you lemons, sometimes it can feel like you simply can't make lemonade — and you'll need a strong, comforting hand to uplift you. Nearly everyone goes through adversity in their own life's journey, and sometimes a tragic event or a great disappointment can feel like it's knocked you down for good. But some of the most iconic lessons we have been taught in life comes from inspiring leaders who have experienced difficulties all their own. "It's not whether you get knocked down; it's whether you get up," said Vince Lombardi, the real-life coach and leader of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, who led his players to a Super Bowl Championship five times.

Lombardi is a good example of how all comforting wisdom comes from people among various walks of life. Authors from A.A. Milne to Jane Austen captured the spirit of resilience in classic works like Pride and Prejudice, among other contemporary titles. More recently, though, even some of our favorite musicians have found ways to embody the spirit of picking yourself up and dusting yourself off when things get tough. Taylor Swift's own personal journey is a great example: "If somebody hurts you, it’s okay to cry a river: Just remember to build a bridge and get over it."

Whether you're looking for comforting advice from one of our country's greatest political inspirations — with names like Elenor Roosevelt and Barbara Bush included — or a simple pick me up from a strong woman who knows a thing or two — we're looking at you, Dolly! — this collection of comforting quotes can help you overcome whatever life throws at you.
