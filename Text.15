There are some skills of how to comfort someone when thery are sad.

1. Gently ask them why.

If they do admit to feeling down, asking why without being pushy is another invitation for them to talk about it, which can be healing in itself.

2. Say something to identify with them. 

You may not have gone through what they're experiencing, but try to identify with their feelings. Even something as simple as, “If I were you I'd feel really disappointed,” can be comforting.

3.Tell them how sorry you are that they are going through this.

Often we feel really bad for people, but we don't know what to say. When you let them know you wish things were better for them, they feel cared for.

4. Find out if it's situational or persistent.

Some people are only sad when something bad has happened – like the death of someone close, a divorce, or a job loss. If that's the case with the person you're talking to, then that's probably what they'll want to share with you. Telling people what we're going through helps us process it so we can move on. But some people have a chronic struggle with sadness as part of depression or a traumatic past. There's no quick fix. It always helps to be a good listener, and give some of the responses we've already mentioned. 

5. Say something to show your acceptance of them.

Often, when we open up about what's bothering us, we feel vulnerable, afraid we might be judged, or treated with no compassion. If you can thank them for telling you, or say anything affirming about how they're dealing with their sadness, that will be comforting.

6. Give them a hug.

Obviously, you want to be respectful if you don't know the person very well, but someone you know may really appreciate a hug. Some people are more comforted by physical touch than by anything else.

7. Tell them their strengths and attractive features.

Particularly if someone's depressed, sadness can carry with it a sense of failure or low self-worth. It can be helpful and energizing to hear what you see as their good qualities. 

8. Give them a gift that means something.

When I was overwhelmed with the care of premature twins, the gift that meant most to me was a cooked meal on my doorstep. At another time, it was a print of the cover of one of my favorite books, beautifully framed. Both gifts showed that the giver was paying attention to what was going on with me. That kind of thoughtfulness can be a great way to comfort someone.
